FINAL DATA PREPROCESSING & FEATURE ENGINEERING REPORT

1. Missing Value Strategies
- Numerical features were handled using Mean, Median, KNN Imputer, and finally MICE (Iterative Imputer).
- Categorical features were imputed using Most Frequent (Mode) strategy.
- Missing indicator columns were added to preserve missingness information.

Effectiveness:
All missing values were successfully handled without dropping records, ensuring data completeness.

2. Outlier Handling
- Z-score method used to detect extreme outliers.
- IQR method applied to all numerical columns.
- Percentile capping and Winsorization used to reduce the influence of extreme values.

Result:
Outliers were controlled while preserving data distribution.

3. Encoding Methods
- Ordinal Encoding for education level.
- Label Encoding for binary features.
- One-Hot Encoding (sklearn) for region and loan purpose.

4. Feature Scaling & Transformations
- Standardization (Z-score scaling)
- Min-Max Scaling
- MaxAbs Scaling
- Robust Scaling
- PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson)
- FunctionTransformer (log, square root)

Reason:
Improved model stability and convergence.

5. Feature Engineering
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Average Monthly Transactions
- Spending-to-Income Ratio

These features add financial interpretability and predictive strength.

6. Final Dataset Readiness
- No missing values
- Outliers treated
- Fully numeric
- Scaled and encoded
- Ready for Machine Learning models

Final dataset is suitable for classification and regression tasks.
